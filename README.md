Kerfing is a well-known method in subtractive manufacturing used to create flexible surfaces from still planar materials. In this work, we study 3D-printed kerfng to enable freeform movement in rigid polymer materials suitable for FDM (Fused Deposition Modeling). Designers and end users can leverage kerf structures due to their ability to bend in single, double, or multiple axes. With the accessi- bility of consumer-grade 3D printers, kerf structures over an easy approach to fabricating freeform structures and compliant mecha- nisms for interactive primitives and applications like grippers.

Building on the principles and mechanics of traditional subtractive kerf structures, we propose that 3D-printed kerf structures can be modified by varying the shape, cell density, and alignment of cells, which influence their deformation and load-bearing capabili- ties. Additionally, we examine how the unique advantages of 3D printing can further augment the capabilities of kerfing, such as through multi-material printing (e.g., applying a thin TPU layer over PLA at contact points of a kerf-structured gripper for improved friction) or bilayer structures (e.g., using a one-to-one proportion of PLA and TPU material overlaid over one another in the kerf structure for a wearable sensor band). We validate our approach through various applications and the interaction spaces created by kerf designs, such as tangible user interfaces with tunable haptic feedback and robotic grippers.
